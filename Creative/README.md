# Creative Assets for .NET Conf 2024

In this folder, we have placed the official logos, promotional images and other content you may use to promote .NET Conf 2024.

Content is organized into folders with appropriate sizes for the various social media platforms as well as separate folders with logos appropriate for promotion at various stages leading up to the event.

We ask that you do NOT modify the banners beyond resizing them.  Altering the content, changing the fonts, or placing additional text over the images will not represent the .NET and .NET Conf brands in a way that our design team approves.

- [Call for Content Banners](CallForContent-Banners) holds a collection of art you can use for email headers or website placement to encourage speakers to participate in the .NET Conf event
